screensaver.py is the working version which just simply colours the screen with varied hues after a set inactivity time out. The other files were the lead up testing various options.
Raspberry Pi 500 like I use has gone to Wayland screen support but still allows the option to go back to X11 via settings using raspi-configure so you can use apps like xscreensaver.
However, this is bothersome even though I liked the great screens in Xscreensaver but I prefer my Pi to remain with the flow to Wayland and it's improved performance over X11.
In any case the objective to keep the screen from being frozen in one background and windows while I am away from the Pi for lengthy periods.
